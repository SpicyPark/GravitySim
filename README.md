# Welcome to GravitySim!
## Overview
This program is intended to simulate gravity acting upon a ball. When you run the program, a ball appears at the top of the screen and falls to the bottom. Various physics equations are needed to allow for a realistic animation.
## How to use this program
There are currently two possible ways to run this program. You may either go to releases and download the .jar file from the latest release, or download the source code and run the program from an IDE. Currently, there are no user inputs implemented, and the program is just intended to run when opened. For futher information about any release, you may check the documentation in releases. <br><br>
In the graphical user interface (GUI) there are two fluctuating values. The one on top indicates time and the one below it indicates velocity.
